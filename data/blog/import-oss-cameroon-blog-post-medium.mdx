Welcome to OSS Cameroon! from today on, we won’t have any excuse not to gain more visibility by taking advantage of [Medium](https://medium.com) blogging platform.
Because the process of importing an existing article to [Medium](https://medium.com) is quite straightforward… Let’s ✂➡🏃💨.

**_Please do not try an import any publication/article/blog/story on which you don’t own publication rights!!_**

## Prerequisite

Obviously at this point, we should know that generally one needs to have an account if they intend to publish on any platform, especially if they expect some rights on it.

## Import the article

The steps to import an article on _Medium_ are the following:

1. Create/have a free account on Medium site,

2. Have the article already posted on [https://blog.osscameroon.com](https://blog.osscameroon.com)

3. On your desktop browser, log into the Medium account, in this case OSSCameroon’s page.

4. Click on the profile picture -> Stories
